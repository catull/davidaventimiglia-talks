* Who

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"I'm a physicist, data scientist, data engineer, and software
engineer, and I work for [[https://hasura.io/][*Hasura*]], a software technology company that
provides developer-focused tooling products.  I am not, however, a
cybersecurity expert nor a certified financial planner.  Always
consult professionals for security and financial advice."

* Principles

*** Life is about trade-offs

    - Focus, engage, act.
    - Conduct a frank self-assessment.
    - Avoid [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult][Cargo Cults]].

    There Is No Such Thing As Absolute Security.
    #+END_QUOTE
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Security = Risk Management.
    #+END_QUOTE

*** Know Your Enemy

    - Disclosure (Confidentiality)
    - Destruction (Integrity)
    - Denial (Availability)

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The Three Security Goals Are Confidentiality, Integrity, and
    Availability.
    #+END_QUOTE

*** Bottom Up

    - Build authorization into the data model.
    - Apply redundant measures at every level (within reason).
    - Avoid identity erasure.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Defense in Depth as Strategy
    #+END_QUOTE

*** Keep It Simply Simple (KISS)

    - Adopt a small set of principles.
    - Apply them ruthlessly and redundantly.
    - Repeat, repeat, repeat.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Complexity Is the Enemy of Security.
    #+END_QUOTE

*** Least Privilege

    - The most secure API is the one that does nothing at all.
    - Never trust anyone.
    - Opt in.  Don't Opt out.

    When Left on Their Own, People Tend to Make the Worst Security
    Decisions.

* GraphQL Security Orthodoxy

*** Disable Console Access

    - GraphQL servers often host an "admin console".
    - Disable it in production.

*** Disable Schema Introspection

    - Introspection is in the spec and in most (all?) servers.
    - Disable it in production.

*** Disable Query Suggestions

    - /Some/ GraphQL servers try to be overly helpful.
    - Disable it in production.

*** Impose Limits

    - Traditional rate limits are a start but are not enough.
    - Limit rate.
    - Limit time.
    - Limit depth.
    - Limit nodes.
    - Limit complexity.

*** Whitelist Operations

    - Bless a fixed set of allowed queries.
    - Be careful in general.
    - Be careful with Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) in particular.

* GraphQL Security Heterodoxy

*** Don't Confuse Public vs Private.

    - If you don't /need/ to offer a public API, then don't provide one.
    - If you're not providing a public API, then don't act like you are.

*** Don't Disable Console Access

    - If you applied the Bottom-Up and Least Privilege principles,
      then the console can't do anything unauthorized anyway.

*** Don't Disable Schema Introspection and Query Suggestions

    - The public needs to know how to use your public API.
    - The public shouldn't have access to your private API.
    - The information will get out anyway.

*** Don't Use GraphQL Security

    - Or at least, don't rely on GraphQL security.
    - Work diligently from the bottom up, and you (almost) won't need
      it.

*** Don't Use GraphQL

    - For private APIs, that is.
    - Use Allow Lists.
    - And if you're using Allow Lists, turn them into REST endpoints
      or RPCs.
    - GraphQL is for people, not for machines.

* Hasura Demo

* Summary

  - Cybersecurity is a vast topic.
  - Take it seriously and consult with experts.
  - Tame the vastness with a principled approach.
  - Do the easy things for GraphQL, but only because they're easy.
  - Focus, engage, and manage trade-offs.
