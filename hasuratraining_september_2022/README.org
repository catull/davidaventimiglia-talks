#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"I'm a physicist, data scientist, data engineer, and software
engineer.  I work for [[https://hasura.io/][*Hasura*]], a software technology company that
provides developer-focused tooling products.  And, I believe that the
best code is the code that you don't have to write."

* What?

** GraphQL API

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:50%">

- Query Language
- Schema
  - Types
    - Fields
- Types relate to Types
- Sound familiar?

** What We Will Cover

- What is Hasura?
- How do we use them?
- How do we use them well?
- What are the general principles?
- What are the particular details?
- What is the proper mental model?
- How do we get there?

** What is Hasura?

- API Server
- Development Environment

** What is Hasura?

Magic

** How do we use them?

- Build network applications /*faster*/, more /*reliably*/, and /*cheaper*/ with GraphQL.
- Build GraphQL applications /*faster*/, more /*reliably*/, and /*cheaper*/ with Hasura.
- Apply the general principles with training from /*Hasura Developer Relations*/.
- Apply the particular details with support from /*Hasura Developer Success*/.

** How do we use them well?

- Adopt a principled approach.
- Develop a proper mental model.

** What are the general principles?

1. Build for humans.
2. Build with personas.
3. Build in the database.
4. Build a data model.
5. Remember OLTP vs OLAP.

** What is the proper mental model?

- Hasura ~graphql-engine~ is the API server, is on the data plane, and is on the critical path.
- Hasura ~console~ is part of the development environment, is on the control plane, and is off the critical path.
- Hasura ~CLI~ is part of the development environment, is on the control plane, and is far off the critical path.

** What is the proper mental model?

- The key functional concerns are: data modeling, API development, security, and integrations.
- The key non-functional concerns are: deployment, caching, monitoring.

** How do we get there?

- Track 1: Development
- Track 2: Deployment

* Track 1: Development

** Setup

** Modeling

** Security

** Actions

** Events

** APIs

** Remote Joins

** Remote Schema

* Track 2: Deployment

** Self-Hosted vs Cloud

** Development Environment

** CI/CD
