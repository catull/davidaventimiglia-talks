#+begin_NOTES
Note that we don't illustrate authentication in this talk, though we
will touch on it briefly.

*** Principles

- Risk Management :: /Life is about trade-offs./
- Goal Setting :: /Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability/
- Defense in Depth :: /Bottom-Up/
- Simplicity :: /Complexity is the Enemy of Security/
- Least Privilege :: /The most secure API does nothing at all./

*** Threats

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:75%">

- Deep Queries :: /Confidentiality, Availability/
- Recursive Queries :: /Availability/
- Unbounded Queries :: /Confidentiality, Availability/
- Malicious Queries :: /Confidentiality/
- Batch Requests :: /Confidentiality, Availability/

*** Deep Queries / Recursive Queries

#+begin_src graphql
  query {
    author(id: 42) {
      posts {
        author {...and so on...
        }
      }
    }
  }
#+end_src

*** Unbounded / Large Queries

#+begin_src graphql
  query {
    authors(first: 1000) {
      name
      posts(last: 100) {
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
#+end_src

*** Malicious Queries

#+begin_src graphql
  query User {
    user (id: "User*") {
      email
      id 
    }
  }
#+end_src

*** Batch Requests

#+begin_src graphql
  query MaliciousQuery {
    alias1: fieldName { subField1 subField2 ...}
    alias2: fieldName { subField1 subField2 ...}
    ...
    alias10: fieldName { subField1 subField2 ...}
    ...
    alias100: fieldName { subField1 subField2 ...
    ...
    alias1000: fieldName { subField1 subField2 ...}
    ...
  }
#+end_src

* Workshop

*** Log into Heroku

*** Log into Hasura Cloud

*** Create a new Hasura Cloud Project

[[file:assets/create_new_hasura_project.png]]

*** Create a new Heroku database

*** +Connect to the database+

#+begin_src shell :export both
  psql -h <hostname> -p <port> -d <db> -U <username> psql
  heroku psql -a <app>
#+end_src

*** +Secure the DB+

- Create a dedicated DB user for PROD.
- ~REVOKE~ DML (maybe).
- ~REVOKE~ DDL (definitely).
- Use a [[https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/getting-started/docker-simple/][separate dev instance]] with elevated permissions for data modeling.
- Use an env var like ~PG_DATABASE_URL~ with your Hasuras.

#+REVEAL: split

 #+begin_src sql
   -- Read-only? (not on Heroku hobby tier!)
   CREATE USER hasuraprod WITH PASSWORD 'hasuraprod';
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <db> TO hasuraprod;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO hasuraprod;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO hasuraprod;
   GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA <schema> TO hasuraprod;
 #+end_src

*** Secure the Service

- ~HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET~

*** +Add Authentication+

- ~HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK~
- ~HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK_MODE~

*** +Disable Hasura Console+

- ~HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE~

*** Disable Schema Introspection

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%

*** Create the Data Model

#+INCLUDE "./init_data.sql" src sql

*** Set API Limits

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 80%
[[file:assets/set_api_limits.png]]

*** Apply Permissions

*** Use Allow Lists

*** Create REST Endpoints

* Discussion

*** GraphQL Security Orthodoxy

AKA: rituals, cargo cults, security theater which you can get anywhere
- Disable Console Access
- Disable Schema Introspection
- Disable Query Suggestions (unnecessary in Hasura)
- Impose API Limits
- Whitelist Operations

*** GraphQL Security Heterodoxy

AKA: possibly controversial opinions which you will get from me
- Don't confuse public vs private:
- If you don't /need/ to provide a public API, then don't.
- If you're not providing a public API, then don't act like you are.
- Don't disable console access
- If you applied the security principles carefully, deliberately, thoughtfully, then the console can't do anything unauthorized anyway.
- Don't disable schema introspection and query suggestions.
- The public will need to know how to use your public API (which you almost certainly shouldn't have anyway)
- The public shouldn't have access to your private API (you did secure your API, add authentication, disable unauthorized access, build a rich data model, and apply fine-grained authorization, didn't you?)
- The information will get out anyway.
- Don't use GraphQL security
- Or at least, don't rely on it.
- Work diligently from the bottom-up, applying the principles carefully, deliberately, thoughtfully, and you (almost) won't need it.
- Remember "managing risk", "cargo cults", and "security theater".
Life is about trade-offs.
- Don't use GraphQL
- For private APIs, that is.
- Use Allow Lists.
- And if you're using Allow Lists, you might as well use REST endpoints.
- GraphQL is for /people/ (i.e. developers), not for machines.
