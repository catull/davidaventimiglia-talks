* Principles

*** Data Independence

#+begin_quote
"Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should
remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
and even when some aspects of the external representation are
changed." -- E.F. Codd 1970
#+end_quote

*** Information Principle

/All/ information is represented by the same model.

*** Consistency

Data consistency is enforced not by imperative application rules but
by declarative database constraints.

* Theory

*** Relational Model

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:50%">

- relation :: (heading, body)
- heading :: {attributes}
- body :: {tuple}
- attribute :: (name, domain)
- name :: /text/

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">

- domain :: /text/
- tuple :: {value} where value ∈ domain
- predicate :: {proposition}
- proposition :: =true= | =false=

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

*** Interrogating the Model

- relational calculus :: declarative language for performing optimizations
- relational algebra :: imperative language for performing transformations

*** Application

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:50%">

- relation :: table | view | query
- attribute :: column
- tuple :: row
- domain :: type
- proposition :: query

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">

- relational algebra :: Π σ ⨝
- projection Π :: choose columns
- selection σ :: choose rows
- join ⨝ :: product of relations

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

*** Normalization

- UNF:  anything goes
- 1NF:  atomic columns
- 2NF:  no functional dependencies within table
- 3NF:  no functional dependencies to other tables
- 4NF, 5NF, 6NF:  refinements but don't worry

*** Demo

[[http://clotho.uom.gr/relax/calc.htm][RelaX - relational algebra calculator]]

[[https://gist.github.com/dventimihasura/2c2bca3625f268a5c61f510b3f3cb3e8][gist:2c2bca3625f268a5c61f510b3f3cb3e8]]

* Reality

*** Climbing Down the Ivory Tower

The mathematical formalism is useful for reasoning, but all database
implementations deviate from the strict mathematical model for
practical purposes.

*** Real Databases

- depart from set theory (hello duplicates)
- depart from simple relational theory (hello ~GROUP BY~ AND ~ORDER BY~)
- depart from first-order predicate logic (hello ~NULL~)
- extend the basic model (hello ~OUTER JOIN~)

*** Tables

- not much to say, except
- there are only "relations"
- parent-child, one-to-many, many-to-many are not a thing

*** Views

- not much to say, except
- they're saved queries
- /not/ an performance barrier, except
- when they do too much

*** Keys

- primary
  - simple
  - composite
  - "pseudo-keys"
  - +sequences+

*** Constraints

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">
- Foreign
- Check
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">
- Not-Null
- Unique
- Exclusion
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

*** Indexes

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">
- Clustered (not really a thing in Postgres)
- Non-Clustered
- Implementation for constraints
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width:50%">
- Expression Indexes
- Partial Indexes
- Covering Indexes
#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

*** Data Dictionary

- One of the hallmarks of a RDBMS

*** Transactions

- ACID: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable
- A: all or nothing
- C: satisfies constraints
- I: visible or not
- D: true committment

*** Concurrency

*** Implementation Details

- Files or Volumes
- Pages
- Extents
- Rows
- Values
- Read performance
- Write performance
- Page splitting

* Summary

*** Key Ideas

- Mathematical Foundation
- Deductive Reasoning
- Powerful Optimizations
- Sophisticated Code Generation

* The End

* Additional Slides

* History
